    <h2>Michael Jackson</h2>
    <p>My favorite album is Dangerous.Michael Jackson was the king of pop and that will never change. He is the only artist to have received 8 awards in one night and the only person in history to have two Hollywood Stars. Michael Jcakson will always be the best artist ever lived.</p>

    <p>I use Apple Music everyday to go to school and coming home from school. It's my daily routine and I have to listen to it. It's lots of types of music. It goes from rap to R and B to Hip Hop. </p>
